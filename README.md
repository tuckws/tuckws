# Hello, I'm Tucker. Welcome to my GitHub.

## Objective
As a Military Intelligence Officer and Counterintelligence Special Agent for the last ten years, I developed a passion for the world of cybersecurity. Whether conducting threat analysis, security assessments, or federal crminial investigations, I constantly found myself humbled by cyber's ubiquitous presence in our lives. This fostered a drive in me to pursue a cybersecurity career post military service. I am actively seeking to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as an Analyst with the eventual goal to branch into Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).
